Turns on, beeps and turns back off. Big expense for my little business.\n", "\n  We bought a second one because the first one died.  The second one had one redeeming feature:  it was bright yellow so we could find it easily.  But the battery power died quickly.  So then we bought a third one, a red heavier one that seemed to be a newer model.  But that one never worked properly; strange beeping, inconsistently well-behaved, frustrating for both staff and customers.  But support was so bad from Socket that we then went back to using the first one again while having it plugged in most of the time since at least it worked reliably (I should have sent the second one back to amazon but didn't) .. now we finally bought a third one from a different vendor, who advertised a bright blue and sent us a navy one.  And now I'm realizing that we won't need to use the socket much longer because we're switching POS systems and I am sending the darned thing back!!!\n", "\n  This is the scanner that shopify recommends for use on ipad so i was forced to purchase them.  I have now purchased 6 of these and 5 are defective.  i have wasted 6 weeks going back and forth with Socket Scan and they have no quality control program and will just tell you it works at their office.  You cannot use this product for all the inventory functions in shopify.  then the support team goes dark for days at a time.  Then you go through a ridiculous exchange program where you pay to send it back and wait weeks for the new device if you are lucky.", "The performance is terrible anyway but there were no other options for wireless scanners on shopify.  DO NOT BUY THIS SCANNER.  you will be much better off buying a cheap wireless scanner for $20 and hooking it up to a laptop and everything will work perfect.  THIS IS A NIGHTMARE that you do not want to bring upon yourself\n", "\n  I had to exchange the first because the battery started to die within minutes after only about a month of use. The second one did the same only worse. These are WAY too expensive to have that happen.\n", "\n  I have seen some of the reviews for this scanner and was hesitant to get it but it's the only one that is compatible with the Shopify POS. I am surprised at how easy it is to use and it's reliability. It certainly makes check out easy and customers are impressed at how we are able to quickly get their items scanned and checked-out. So far so good with this scanner. I will come back in a few months and provide an update.\n", "\n  The barcode scanner works well, if you have the right hardware. I hope that I could use it independently, but it requires a tablet that can access the Shopify app that I need to access my inventory. Ended up returning it, but if I had a more tech savvy team this would work great.\n", "\n  I order this for my embroidery business to track inventory. It\u2019s a wonderful addition to my shop and pairs and works flawlessly with my iPad Pro. I have also used it with an iPad 4th generation and it worked great as well.

It was so natural to set up and it worked for what I need when I associated the Bluetooth. I just supplanted a long term old corded scanner with this one thus far I love it. It accommodates my hand easily and doesn't feel modest in any capacity. I have just utilized it for one day yet I am now similar to; for what reason did I stand by so long to get one? The one thing that would be pleasant however is a fitting or spread to go over the USB port for when the scanner isn't charging. I will conceivably alter this later for any issues and to refresh the battery life after I have utilized it for a month or something like that.\n", "\n  I will start by saying \u2018thank-goodness for Amazon customer service!!\u2019  I have returned two of these scanners and am waiting for a third one to arrive. Amazon has been simply amazing.", "Now, on to my review of the scanner:", "The low-battery light will start flashing regardless of state of charge.  Judging by the reviews, this has been a common problem for this particular model. I have to believe that Socket Mobile must be aware that there is a problem with some of their products. I have tried to get some info from them on how to solve this problem with the battery light constantly flashing, but their customer service is less then stellar; just giving me the run-around. I will NOT pay to ship a brand new product to them for warranty service. This is not an isolated case; they should be recalling all the defective scanners and replacing them at their own expense.", "It might be okay for \u2018light-duty\u2019 work, but if you need the scanner to hold a charge or if you wear down the battery too much, the light will start flashing and NEVER stop... even after recharging it or even after changing the batteries.", "I have owned (still do) the older model (7ci), which was an excellent product;  but the new 700-series are a disappointment. At this price-point there are numerous better alternatives.", "I am giving it a third try, but if I get the same results (which I am expecting) I will return it to Amazon and this will be the last product I buy from this company.", "Very disappointed!\n", "\n  We've been using this scanner for one month and the battery light keeps blinking. It also uses at least 2 AA batteries EVERY WEEK. We've tried multiple brands of batteries. This can't be normal so I contacted customer service to get it fixed since it's still under warranty. I was told that I can send it back but I am responsible for the cost of sending the faulty scanner back.

It works great on my desk. My favorite part and the reason I chose this stand over others that are smilar was the place for the charging cable. You do not have to disconnect the charger to remove this phone from the stand. The design allows you to pick up the phone from the stand with the charger still plugged in. Others do not have an open top. So you have to thread the cable through a hole so it becomes a pain to pick up and put down your phone.\n", "\n  Great product. Cheap price, great quality. I bought this thinking it would be any old regular phone holder made out of thin metal. However, when I got this I was pleasantly surprised. It's strong and sturdy. Bottom grip is great and the part where it holds the phone provides grip too. The gaps in the middle and by the bottom allow you to wire a charger through; you can mount your phone and charge it at the same time without having to worry about damaging your cable! I bought the gold one and it loooks really nice as well. Very happy with my purchase\n", "\n  I bought two of these to keep on my desk at work and I love them.

They also have small silicone grippy pads where the phone sits, so the phone doesn\u2019t slide or get roughed up by the edges of the stand. I LOVE THESE!", "I ordered the rose gold/pink ones and they are very true to color in the product photos.\n", "\n  The price seemed high for what it is. But I'm SO GLAD I overcame my hesitation and bought this extremely well made heavy duty but great high end looking phone desk stand. The matte finish and elegant curves will look great on my desk at work. The thick aluminum is no toy. Unless it's run over by a car it'll outlive me. And I especially appreciated the thin unobtrusive rubber feet that'll keep the stand from sliding if my charging cable is jostled. I expect that my coworkers will ask where they can buy one...and I'll tell them.  (& I just now bought another one for home!)\n", "\n  I am very happy with this iPhone holder. I had ordered one from a different company and it was way too large to sit on my desk, even though it was for a cell phone. This one has a smaller footprint and is heavy enough to hold the phone without falling over. While you cannot angle the screen like some of the others, it is really not necessary for a phone. This keeps my phone where I can find it easily and you can run the power cord through it as well. I almost did not see the little package inside the box that comes with the rubber pads to keep the phone from getting scratched.  The only thing I don\u2019t understand is why each rubber pad was a different size. Btw, I  only saw them when I was about to return the item because I was afraid of scratching my phone\u2026 When I opened the box to return it, the little package fell out. Great product for a great price.\n", "\n  Very happy with this product.  I purchased this product to hold my phone vertically so I can read books in my phone.  It is perfect for when you want to read or look at photos or scroll on Instagram.  I would not use for Selfies as it would not be a flattering angle, you would be looking down in the photos.  For selfies I prefer my phone to be up much higher.  I also love the Rose Gold color, as it matches perfectly with my other Rose Gold office accessories (see photo).  I would give 5 stars, as it is perfect for my purposes -- but I felt I had to leave off one star in case someone is intending to use it for selfies (Note:  I was not intending to use this product for selfies anyway, so for me it's really a 5 star product).\n", "\n  I have a Note 8 and can't use this with phone vertically with the case on while charging, which is the whole reason I got it. My case already allows me to stand my phone horizontally, which is the only way I can use this stand while charging my phone in it's case. The ledge and where the cord slot stops is too shallow to stand the phone vertically with the case on because the case adds just enough depth that the charger plug is too far forward to allow the phone to sit on the ledge without falling forward. Since most people use a case, and as far as I know all plugs are on the bottom of the phone, this stand is pretty much useless if you don't want to keep taking your phone in and out of the case to use the stand while charging vertically. I would imagine the same problem would exist for thicker phones or chargers with a thicker end where it plugs into the phone, because without the case it literally is the exact measurement to fit.\n", "\n  The stand is so small so if you try to have it plugged in to charge there is no room for the cord. It is pretty much useless. I have ordered another brand that allows for room for the charger plug and wire. I like to have my phone charging in my office while I'm working, not just sitting there. It shows that there is room for the cord and plug going into the phone but in reality the stand is so small and I have a small iPhone 6, there is still no room for the plug and cord.\n", "\n  This product is good and handles the weight of the phone really well.

I found this one shortly after and I\u2019m glad i did. You can adjust this stand shorter or taller and adjust it more upward or forward. It also has a place at the bottom where i can put my AirPods on.

It\u2019s adjustable vertical and horizontal as well as swivels 360 degrees. I love the fact that there is a loop in the back for your charger to go through. I have an iPhone 8 Plus. I have not yet try my tablet on this but I\u2019m sure it won\u2019t be a problem. The stand is stable and sturdy. I have room at the bottom for my Apple Watch stand & and iPods and charger. I would definitely recommend this stand.", " Received stand and just now open it to put it together; it is very dusty and it did not come in the plastic wrapping and the box didn\u2019t have a seal.

This one is rock solid, very easy to put together by one screw and adjusts perfectly to any angle.  Base is thick and has weight to where my phone never falls over, even at any angle that I could find. No cons, could not find any flaws to where I am very happy with the purchase.\n", "\n  I think for the price, this is a good value.", "The delivery was quick but the unit is delivered in its original box vs contained in an Amazon box.  There was no tape so the box flap had come undone and the product could have emptied out.  As this is an Amazon delivery (\"Items shipped from Amazon.com\"), that's their problem and not the company.  I sent those comments to Amazon.", "Out of the box it was an easy assembly with only one screw.  I see in the ad that they mention some parts made of metal.  The main part of the telescoping pole is metal and, hard to tell, but the base is too.  There are lots of plastic pieces and parts too to include the main part which holds the phone and the hinge with loop in the back.  I saw the one pic/review with the broken plastic connection.  If I were to choose a part to be metal, it would have been the moving parts--the hinge.  No concerns at the moment that this will hold together but only time will tell.", "I like the wide base, as advertised.  As I play with trying to tip it over, it appears quite resistant.  I also like the ring in the back to keep the cord out of the way when plugged in.  I also like that the pad the phone rests on is non-skid silicone and it covers the whole surface.  Lots there to prevent the phone from sliding off.  However, the feet on the base are different material and don't appear to be skid-proof.  Oh well.", "I do wish the telescope was a little more--taller.  I'm still looking down at full extension.  However, as advertised, it telescopes 1.4\".  The hinge in the back works fine and there is no need to tighten it to change the angle the phone is at.  I see the comments from other owners that it doesn't hold.  It appears to be friction so maybe there is concern that it loosens over time.  Let's hope not.", "I'd buy this one again.", "*** Update (12 Sep) - no issues.  Hasn't broken (ref other reviews).  Although I've been very very careful to not pick it up from the top and only from the base.  The joint is still strong and offers secure positioning.

Needless to say, they had worked well for me.", "As I have changed phone service to AT&T, I bought the new portable Weboost 470135. The product is sleek and professionally built with easy to follow and setup instructions. It does come with a lot of handy accessories for mounting the phone holder. Per my uploaded pictures, the portable cell phone booster did help to boost up both the voice signal as well as data speed marginally.", "Depending on your cell phone tower locations, please don't expect miracle to your voice and data. It is only a marginally improvement. The cell phone booster used to cost 3 times less for the same function. Perhaps, the cost of sub-contract manufacturing or advertising has increased. Anyway, Weboost Drive Sleek 470135 did work for me on AT&T but with marginal improvement to voice and data. As such, I would only recommend it if you need it as a cheaper alternative to other more pricey model. Depending on your needs and if you need more quality signal boost than 1 bar, I recommend getting the other more expensive models from Wilson or (even other make). That usually cost much more in my view.\n", "\n  I have to say that I am completely dissatisfied with this product!  This is the second one I purchased.  The first unit went up in smoke, literally, the very first time I powered it up.  The second one did not perform at all.  It didn't increase my signal when it was low and made absolutely no difference in reception whatsoever when I had two or three bars.  Too bad for all concerned.\n", "\n  We drove from Tx through New Mexico into the Colorado mountains. We lost signal in 6 areas on the way to our remote cabin. But using the WeBoost all the way home, we NEVER lost signal & 2 others were using my phone as a hotspot for wifi !  While at the remote cabin, we were told by the owners we wouldn't have data or cell signal.  Sure enough, nothing! So I setup the WeBoost in the upstairs bedroom putting the magnetic antenna out the window. We had 4G 2-3bar signal AND we even streamed Dish TV shows!!\n", "\n  I had an older version of this that seemed to work somewhat so bought this new version to use.  After using it a couple months it didn\u2019t really seem to help at all so I went to different spots where I have minimal service and set my phone to the field test to see the actual strength of the signal and with or without the booster the signal strength was the same.  It had ZERO effect on it.  ZERO effect on calls or data or anything.  It does turn on the little white light, which is extremely annoying while driving at night btw, but that was the only thing they claim that it does that it actually did.\n", "\n  Well I got this product originally back in early April I believe. It worked for a couple months and quit. Customer service was great and I got a replacement right away. Well the replacement was in for a couple months and has quit again. I followed all directions. This is a very expensive product for it to only last a couple months. Not very happy.\n", "\n  I have owned the Drive Sleek for almost a year and have genuinely pleased with its ability to boost very low signal. In general, I get about double the range from a tower as I would without the booster. That said, because I live in southern West Virginia and cell towers are very few and very far between, there are still many areas where even this booster is not powerful enough. So I do have some regrets getting the Drive Sleek over its more powerful cousins, the Drive 4G-M and Drive 4G-X. If you only need a booster to cover the occasional deadzones, this would be a great choice. However, if you are like me and live in an area with you only have pockets of cellular signal and almost no signal everywhere else, I would recommend going with one of weBoost's more powerful boosters.\n", "\n  I use this in the mountains in Southern California last weekend. I was driving through dips and hills in a known area for dropped calls. I called a friend and started a conversation without the booster. Yes the calls were dropping and annoying. I installed the booster and continued on the same terrain and started another call. I did not drop the call again and drove through the hilly section for another 20 minutes until out and into a good cell area. It did work great there. We then went to our campground where there was only 1 bar of service in and out. I was disappointed that the booster did not bring that marginal 1 bar in but we were in trees. If we drove out of the trees it would work again. I am pleased that it does work when when not obstructed too much. I would recommend this product for long highway trips but don't expect it to work miracles if obstructed to heavily.\n", "\n  The biggest issue with signal boosters is they have to use the same frequency coming in as going out. This creates the potential for a feedback look that shuts the device down.  Wilson not being stupid and having a lot of experience has gotten around this with a VERY short reception area for the cell phone.  For optimum results the phone HAS to be in the cradle and the system works quite well as long as there is a tower for your carrier within reach.  Having an understanding of how cell phones work and the what it takes to boost a signal is quite helpful in obtaining optimum results.\n", "\n  Producto muuuy prometedor pero la realidad es que deja mucho que desear.

The thing I hate the most is that IT COMES WITH ZERO INSTRUCTIONS. You are completely on your own. What moron thought this would be a good idea? I\u2019ve downloaded the app, I\u2019ve watched two videos on YouTube and neither I nor my 14 year old son can figure it out.

If I can figure it out, use it and find it helpful for my vlog, I\u2019ll come back and alter my review. But for now, I\u2019m totally pissed. Not intuitive. Not user friendly. No instructions.

First one didn't work with my iphone 11 max so back it went. The second one had so many controls I thought of calling NASA! I got this OSMO mobil 3 and love it! It was easy to connect. Only a few buttons but it packs a punch. The folding feature is great. It fits nicely in your hand. The app works very well. I love that all your files are saved to your phone, not the app like the last gimbal. It was easy to download a full size operations manual. Plenty of youtube videos to walk you through the settings. This thing rocks!\n", "\n  This gimbal by DJI in particular is one of the best. I did quite a bit of research and I don't want to return but I have to. My only problem is that it is not compatible with my new phone I recently got. (Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra).

It brings a stability and composition to my personal videos that I could never get with a hand-held video. I recommend this phone gimbal.\n", "\n  I just returned my DJI Osmo Mobile 3 because I could not get it to work. Both the usability and the documentation of the device appear to be very poor. I might have eventually gotten it to work, but I had so many difficulties that I do not trust I could rely on this device in the field. I will keep looking for a gimbal that is easy to use and reliable. One of the specific issues I had was that I never got past the blinking green light, despite the fact that I balanced my phone on the device. The documentation seemed to say that if I held down the power button, there would be a beep and the green light would become solid. But when I held down the power button, the device just turned off. I had other issues as well, especially with a lack of documentation.\n", "\n  Bought two OSMO 3 for a very important event this weekend having used earlier units with success. Totally worthless.

I have previous used a magnet mount and a air vent mount. I wanted something sturdy and adjustable. I like this one and placed one in my Lexus RX350 and one in our Tacoma. So far we are very pleased. If we have any issues in the near future I will update my review. I also like that this one has a 12 month warranty.", "Edit: updating my review after about three month. In response to what someone else said that the gray part bubbles in the heat- it may do this but it doesn\u2019t damage and the bubbles go away. Not an issue at all. Both of my holders are standing strong. This is the best holder I could find and have ever used. I\u2019m adding a photo to show how my husband did his sticking the suction cup only. REMEMBER TO THOROUGHLY CLEAN YOUR DASH FIRST.\n", "\n  This is the third one of these things I've ordered, trying to fit into the small vent of my Nissan Versa.  I ordered this because of the suction cup option but alas, my dashboard has NO flat surfaces to adhere to, the dash is all curves.  However, the vent clip fit perfectly into the small air conditioning vent and the thing is very sturdy, and holds my iPhone 8 plus with a fold over case just fine.  Adjusts great.  Finally, the right one.\n", "\n  It is very easy to install. Light, small and comfortable for my car (corolla). I am really delighted because I can put it on the windshield or on the dashboard and it is totally stable. I was worried that the cell phone would move from side to side or that it would fall off while it was driving, but the clip is firm and secure. It also comes with a small clip to put the phone on the air vent, so I can use it when I change cars. It was an excellent purchase, I totally recommend it.\n", "\n  By far, this is the best car phone holder I ever found after trying almost everything in the market. The extension feature and flexibility to reposition it is awesome! The suction and adhesiveness was not strong to hold a heavy phone on the dash board or windshield alone. I had to use suction on windshield and position the extended arm over the dashboard (se pic) to hold it safely without dropping from windshield. The front brackets could be redesigned to make it deeper and perhaps adjustable as well, with option to better grab and secure thick and heavy phones that use extra power battery (like mophie). The price is fair for the quality of the product. It is the most sturdy and reliable car phone holder to have, specially when driving over bumpy road. Highly recommended!\n", "\n  I have a Kia soul 2014 and the kia soul has a circle in the middle the stand worked perfectly for my car. Great buy.. it wasn't bulky or anything like that.\n", "\n  I really like this car mount. It latched to my dashboard immediately, and holds very strong - I can wiggle and readjust my phone without worrying of it falling. It looks simple and stylish, not too big and doesn\u2019t obscure the view. Would definitely recommend it. Great product\n", "\n  I purchased this phone holder after having purchased a similar model the vendor sells.  Like the other model, this is extremely well built and NOT flimsy at all.  It allows you to position the phone in almost every position you can think of.  The holder has firm \"jaws\" that firmly but gently hold the phone in place.  You can easily charge your phone with the opening they provide at the bottom and easily remove the phone with the push of one button.  i have an iphone 5 with an otterbox case and it held the phone snugly.  The padded backing makes a nice secure fit on the phone.  I set up the phone on a weighted bean bag mount on my dashboard in order that I had free and clear site rather than put it on the window.  This is just a personal preference.  The suction mount holds nice and tight and I can adjust the position of the phone horizontally or vertically as needed for phone calls or GPS.  It is also handy when I receive calls, to simply put the call on speaker and use it as a hands free phone that is required on my state.\n", "\n  With the fact that nearly everything is made in China and cheaply designed, I was really expecting the worst with this. I've owned many mounts, some good and some not so good. I drive a lot for work, so I usually get to spend a good deal of money on my mobile phone mounts. This easily is one of the cheaper ones I've tried, which made me a bit concerned, but to my surprise it's easily one of the best mounts I've owned. This mount holds a an iPhone XR very well to the dash of a large SUV with worn suspension. My wife drives this SUV like she's auditioning for a role in Mad Max yet somehow this mount holds onto the phone and keeps it where it's supposed to be.

My iPhone 8 Plus fits perfectly with the Otterbox case I have. The stand can be adjusted for the phone to be completely upright or level. I like that it keeps my neck from hurting because I don\u2019t have to look down while reading. It even works on my couch and other furniture.

In my situation, I have an apple iphone case that has a flap which i use to hold the phone and it free floats on top of the arms.  The adjustable hinge has not loosened or gotten any different as we use it.

It is simply a very well made stand that includes an adjustable holder (which was smart \"user\" thinking).  I got the silver color, it looks great and has a soft satin finish.  The anti-skid pads they include do a fantastic job of holding the whole thing and the phone in place.  The stand itself is all metal with some heft before you add the phone.  I've cobbled a few of my own home-made phone stands over the years.  Had I known about this one, I'd of bought it in a heartbeat and declared victory.  Don't look any further if you have wanted a stand that allows your phone to comfortably sit either vertically or horizontally on your desk.  I can't say enough about how well designed and crafted this product is and the price is well...just \"icing on the cake\".\n", "\n  Edited to add: I have liked mine so much that I now ordered one as a gift for my daughter.

I wish they had aftermarket cases though, ha.\n", "\n  I have always used budget phones and the last Blu phone I had was the HD R1 that lasted over 16 months as my Daily phone till I dropped it the wrong way, with a case, and shattered the screen. I got an email from Blu about this model and was intrigued by the features and spec.  All of Blu\u2019s other lower end phones suck because of their specs but this one would fit the bill. I got this phone for my 9 year old son. Unfortunately he\u2019s still in the learning stages of how to be responsible for things and broke the last Older iPhone we gave him while roller skating outside. I call this type of phone a disposable phone cause of the cost. if it breaks, it was only $60, replace it with another.  Build quality is pretty good, the 3000mah battery life is awesome and lasts for days.  My son has Roblox and a few games on it, he doesn\u2019t complain that it\u2019s slow. We also added a parent link app to where we control his screen time which is cool.  Remember the price people !!  Don\u2019t give a bad review trying to compare this to a flagship phone cause it\u2019s not !! Some complain about not having a selection of cases, duh !! It\u2019s Blu and even other small name brand companies do NOT offer a case but be lucky Blu gives you a free one in the box with the phone !! For now it\u2019s working well. I may just buy a couple more and have them in inventory cause they are so cheap and if one breaks, replace it. Thanks Blu for making a great replacement for the HD R1. It\u2019s a good design with good specs.\n", "\n  Someone explain why in hell I bought a phone that I absolutely cannot find a case to buy for it?! BLU, when you go to their freaking website, and click \"SHOP\" brings you smack dab right back here to amazon! Yet AMAZON FREAKING SEARCH does NOT have a single case for a phone THEY SELL! There is NO MODEL NUMBER to reference! Just \"Studio Mini 5.5\" but NOTHING AT ALL MATCHES when you search for a BLU Studio Mini Case! NOTHING! NOT the camera hole, NOT the power button hole, NOT the volume button hole. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING AT ALL! You're trying the tell me THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO DAMN CASE WHATSOEVER other than what came in the damn box?! If you want to protect your phone DON'T BUY THIS ONE! SO DISGUSTED!\n", "\n  After getting the phone and going to my provider for a nano sim....  You must run the android update to get all of the features.  My phone would not allow ringtone, alarm, or notification changes until after the update completed.  Other than that it's a BLU phone.  It's fast enough to get the job done, relatively good reception in the house and 5 bars out side as 4G LTE.  Wifi seems a bit intermittent, but the update may have fixed that too.  It's a great replacement for my dead BLU Studio X+ I've had for years.\n", "\n  I got this phone for my 12 year old daughter and wanted something basic without it costing a lot. It was easy to set up and even arrived with a 60% battery charge. I was happy that it came with a screen protector and a clear case because the one I ordered did not fit. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I can\u2019t seem to find another case!", "Update March 29th 2020: This phone was sent in because it stopped charging. Got it back and it\u2019s still taking 13+ hours to charge, if it charges at all. Customer service was great. I will not be buying this phone again though!\n", "\n  Packaging was good and all parts came in. Phone turns on right away and it\u2019s nice and bright everything seems to work accordingly.", "Phone comes with silicon protector.", "Screen protector came broken.\n", "\n  I really liked how it was such a good deal for the price.

Funny thing is that Kodak makes a small 2x3 size camera with built-in printer that does a significantly better job, for only a few dollars more.

It's hit or miss though.  Set up is fairly easy. It needed to be charged out of the box which was a little anticlimactic. But what made me put a review was the fact the printing itself. I tried to print this photo of my kids and what came out was an extremely zoomed in photo that didn't even print the actual subjects. I had to do it a second time and choose a different image because I was afraid of wasting my photo paper. Which is annoying because it's not like this thing just uses regular paper \ud83d\ude44 . Might update this review if customer service reaches out or if I figure it out. Otherwise, just a heads up.  Choose an image that has the subject dead center and is already in the orientation that you want to print in, portrait, choose a portrait image. Landscape, choose a landscape image.\n", "\n  What's great about this printer is that is so light and small you can take it anywhere you need.

Seems to only like it's own brand, which is irritating. The work-around solution was to use the blue calibration sheet from the Kodak ZINC paper with the Polaroid ZINC paper and that make the printer accept the obviously compatible Polaroid ZINC paper, but really, should you have to do this?\n", "\n  This is a present for Christmas, so not sure on the workings on this, but it arrived quickly and well packaged.

Got a small album to house them in, was a great xmas gift.\n", "\n  Its a fab little printer, it is only compatible with Kodak zink paper though and not others so I'm going to keep the calibration sheet (blue one) and try polaroid zink paper, if it works it will be handy as the polaroid ones are easier to get hold of, if it doesn't I have a camera the polaroid ones work in so no drama lol\n"], "description": ["", "", "Make sure this fits", "", "by entering your model number.", "", "", "STEP UP YOUR PRINTING GAME: No more making plans to print tomorrow.
